           <h1>Memorable Places During My Mediterranean Cruise</h1>
           <p>I was stationed onboard a U.S. Naval destroyer during its 6-month cruise throughout the Mediterranean Sea. I was able to do and see many things that I would otherwise not have been able to.</p>

                   <h2>Haifa, Israel</h2>
                   <p>
                       The most memorable stop would have to be Haifa, Israel. I had originally signed up to go on a tour of the Dead Sea, however, it was cancelled. To this day I regret not signing up for the tour of Jerusalem. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Haifa is known as the cultural hub of northern Israel, and its most famous tourist attraction is the <a href="http://ganbahai.org.il/en/">Baha&#769;'i&#769; World Center</a>. It has the most beautiful terraced garden I have ever seen!

                       Pamukkale is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These travertine terraces are created when water from the hot springs, which is supersaturated with calcium carbonate, reaches the surface and carbon dioxide is released. The calcium is then deposited and eventually crystallizes into travertine.

                        While cruising around the Mediterranean, we also traversed the Turkish Straits to enter the Black Sea, where we were able to visit multiple countries on the coast.
